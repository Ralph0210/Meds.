# Medication Tracker

## How to Run

You can start the app using one of these commands in your terminal:

### Option 1: Python (Recommended, built-in)

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Option 2: Node.js

```bash
npx serve
```

### Option 3: Double-click script

I have included a file named `start_app.command`. You can just double-click it in Finder to start the server.
